#Week of 12 HW: Node.js & MySQL

### Objectives

* In this activity I created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Prompt Package.

* The application takes in orders from customers and depletes from the store's total supplies. It also tracks cash-on-hand and cart items.
